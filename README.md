## Dataset metadata
Dataset Title : Consumer Complaint Database

Dataset published by : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

Description : The Consumer Complaint Database is a collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that we sent to companies for response. Complaints are                 published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first. Complaints referred to other                 regulators, such as complaints about depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, are not published in the Consumer Complaint Database.

Keywords : ["consumer", "finance", "complaint", "bank account", "bank service", "credit card", "credit report", "debt collection", "money transfer", "mortgage", "student loan", "loan"]
