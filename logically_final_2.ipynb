The federal reserve system ( fractional illegal banking ) most Americans have no idea how our banking system works let alone the federal Reserve. It literally is the greatest ponzi scheme in history. Its completely unconstitutional and has created a disportion of wealth where the majority are slaves to banks. No where in our constitution does it state an independent banking system issuing these federal reserve notes that are now practical worthless has any authority, nor use our federal taxes as collateral against these loans.

Im asking every single one of my creditors to follow the United States tax law with regards to debt. I want every single one of my creditors who wrote off my debt as a loss on their tax returns and recouped their money to remove that debt from XXXX and Transunion. The Federal tax law states \" Attempting to collect such monies, fees, etc. for an unsecured debt that has been claimed on federal taxes as a loss, and sold to another company for compensation constitutes fraud in any of the 50 states. \\'\\' It makes sense and all my creditors didnt hide they wrote it off. I want these collection companies who have no legal claim to this debt that again has been written off removed from my credit report and in reality they themselves are commiting tax fraud by trying to collect on these debts that no longer belong to me off my credit report. This is the law. Its not enforced but it should be. Big banks have lawyers who know tax law and get their clients to pay little to no taxes.

It was quick to determine that the initial agent did review much of my file and had double counted about half of my debts along with not addressing other items such as transfers between my accounts. My gut feeling and general instinct from here, being that I had to escalate my complaints with their negligence ( possibly gross negligence ) and poor service, was that they would need to find a way to cover for their errors and poor care, or to find a way to retaliate against my complaints. However still curious to see if they actually would or not.\\n\\nAs my time has been pressing and PennyMac had already wasted a lot of it, I sought other lenders who I was not a current customer of. There the customer service was considerably better. They did stop to ask the right questions when needed and in only a few days they were able to get pre-approvals out and I have been able to move forward on my transaction. Additionally they stated to me that they could approve me for a considerable amount more than I was asking for. Their rate is the same that I was quoted from PennyMac but unfortunately I have more in fees as I'm not an existing customer. But unbelievable how much better and responsive the service has been. \\nStill waiting on PennyMac, though I am approx 2 weeks in with the other lender, but only really due to curiosity at this point ; to see if they will continue with the retaliation I had suspected.

It is inconceivable that this financial institution be allowed to continue to operate under the guise of integrity. Case in point is Wells Fargos dismissive accountability for the loans and decisions that theyve made and continue to make today. Ive asked Wells Fargo repeatedly to investigate a 2010 loan modification that was offered, of which I had no choice but to decline at the time, as the modification only placed past due payments onto the back of loan leaving all the same destructive amortization terms and conditions in place. Due my financial hardship at the time and the fact that acceptance of said modification stipulated that I waived any and all rights legal rights or actions. \\nMy compliant lies squarely with Wells Fargos as they keep insisting that placing past due payments on the back of the same toxic loan is somehow an acceptable modification that was going to miraculously keep me current on said loan for the foreseeable future.This tells me that Wells Fargo hasnt bothered to go back and review my 2010 finical hardship documentation and come clean with the fact that I was offered a self-destructive modification product that due to my then finical situation would have left me not only with a defaulted modification, but with no legal right to stay in my home. \\nIt is at this time that I seek out the assistance of the District Attorney of Florida and request a full investigation into the how Wells Fargo is conducting their reviews of complaints being submitted as I have done my homework and have all modification application documentation that proves that the 2010 modification was unjust and set up to fail and anything other than that finding is an attempt by wells Fargo to check a box and claim compliance.\\n\\nWells Fargos continued omission of responsibility as it regards to their sins of the past has cost me and my family a decade of pain and suffering, one that I will never forget or stop fighting as I seek out an amicable and final resolve.

In addition, California, my home state, has been particularly hit by the general lockdown that was declared in XXXX. It is not under discussion that COVID has seriously impacted Americans ability to travel since XX/XX/2020. \\nThe Chase Sapphire Reserve card includes mostly travel benefits ( Priority Pass membership, XXXX, 3x points on travel, {$300.00} annual travel credit, etc. ). COVID has then impacted seriously the ability of Reserve cardholders to make use of the travel benefits of the account for over a quarter so far. Considering that the annual membership fee is {$550.00}, the prorrated amount for one quarter would be {$180.00}, so requesting a {$100.00} statement credit is actually not that much, but a little help to the consumer. \\nMy Reserve account was renewed in XX/XX/2020 ; there is no doubt that I have been seriously impacted by COVID on my ability to make use of the travel benefits of the card since XX/XX/2020 up to date ( for over a quarter so far and still counting ). For this reason, it does not make sense to me that Chase is only extending a {$100.00} statement credit to Reserve cardholders that are renewing their accounts from XXXX through XX/XX/2020. This should have been instead a retention offer to prevent those consumers from canceling or downgrading their accounts. There is no doubt that consumers who had the card renewed in XXXX like myself have been impacted as much as those that had their card renewed since XXXX and for whom the {$100.00} statement credit is automatically extended. Therefore, I am again kindly requesting Chase to do the right thing and extend me the {$100.00} statement credit on my Reserve account to partially offset the impact of COVID-19 on the travel benefits of the account since XX/XX/2020.'],\n",

Most recently, the mortgage was serviced by XXXX XXXX XXXX. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX  only to be told that the loan was sold on XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX. This XXXX  ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I contacted XXXX XXXX only to be told that only to be told that as of XX/XX/XXXX that the loan had been sold to Rushmore Loan Management Services. Rushmore won't be available until Monday ( XX/XX/XXXX ). \\n\\nThis matter actually began 4 years ago, and this is the SECOND foreclosure of this property that I have experienced despite my not being in the property for almost 4 years. This property was initially foreclosed upon in XX/XX/XXXX due to getting behind in payments of the home equity line of credit after losing my job. The main mortgage was with XXXX  and was current at the time of foreclosure. Upon the advice of an attorney, we exited the property in XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nApparently, both mortgage companies spent the next 3 years in Court arguing over who had primary position. In XX/XX/XXXX, the judge issued a summary judgement essentially overturning the original foreclosure. By that time, I had moved on and had moved out of state. About a year ago, I was working with a financial consultant regarding ways to improve my credit. It was then that I realized all kinds of things were on my credit report that shouldn't have been. For instance, the foreclosure was on the report as well as negative remarks that I had neglected to pay my mortgage for 2 years since the foreclosure for this property. Similar negative reports were on my report regarding the home equity line of credit. \\n\\nIt has been quite difficult to secure an attorney to assist in this matter. First of all, it is a requirement that the attorney be licensed in the state where the property is located ( Mississippi ). Secondly, the attorney needs to be experienced in real estate litigation matters. A number of attorneys that I have been referred to have indicated a reluctance of getting involved because of how many attorneys have been previously involved. ( Both mortgage companies have their own teams of attorneys as well as the 3rd party who bought the property from XXXX XXXX. ) I am not astute when it comes to legal matters, but I truly feel that I have been taken advantage of. The judge rescinding the initial foreclosure after 3 years certainly does not help me. I can not be made whole because the 3 years that my credit took a major hit largely because of the foreclosure can not be undone. \\n\\nShortly after the initial foreclosure, our attorney had us sign a Quitclaim Deed signing the property over to the 3rd party. Our attorney said that this essentially absolves you of any future responsibility for this property ( hence a foreclosure ). That's why we signed the Quitclaim Deed. Well, that's not exactly true according to the Deed of Records with the XXXX XXXX ( MS ) XXXX XXXX. When the foreclosure was rescinded, that meant that legally the property reverted back to me as owner. And the Quitclaim Deed was null and void. The initial foreclosure happened in XX/XX/XXXX ; the Quitclaim Deed was signed in XX/XX/XXXX. Essentially, I didn't have a legal right to convey property that had been already foreclosed on because technically, I did not own it. Which brings me to this mess of a situation that I find myself in. \\n\\nFirst, I don't think that justice or any fairness has been provided to my family. The State of Mississippi has a long history of essentially stealing land from XXXX folks like my family. And XXXX XXXX has a well documented past of screwing over unaware, vulnerable homeowners. Those facts alone should give someone pause to carefully consider how one proceeds from this point. Shortly after the XX/XX/XXXX foreclosure, the 3rd party and the XXXX XXXX XXXX came to my home and advised me that I no longer owned the property and that I should leave ASAP. And if I didn't, I would be charged with trespassing and would be dealt with accordingly. \\n\\nSince the beginning of this year, the servicer of the mortgager has changed from XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and just this week ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to Rushmore Loan Management Services. I'm not even sure who it is that has initiated this second foreclosure. I at least need to know who to speak with regarding my options.\"],\n",

For the past two years, my mortgage company has mailed and called me to tell me that I needed to purchase an insurance plan for my home, even though it is included inside of my escrow payment. I have told the mortgage company each time that it's their responsibility to pay the insurance bill because I am paying them via the escrow account. Here is a detailed date of events this year : XX/XX/XXXX : Mailed me notice to say that they don't have proof of XXXX insurance for my house and that I would need to purchase it and show them proof. I called them immediately afterwards to tell them that it is included in my escrow payment and would not be purchasing a second insurance plan. The mortgage company then was able to show that they did indeed purchase insurance, but they did so three days after my previous policy expired and that I would need to purchase a policy for the three day gap ( XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ). \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX : ( letter dated for XX/XX/XXXX, but I received it later than that ) Received a second notice saying that I needed to purchase insurance for the three day gap or else they would purchase it themselves and it would cost me XXXX. The annual policy is less than 2000 dollars. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX : Called insurance company to buy policy for three days, back dated, as my mortgage company requested. Insurance company said they do not do that and provided me with documentation showing that mortgage company paid the bill for my insurance late, most likely to gain more interest from my escrow payment. Mortgage company claimed that while the insurance company did mail and fax the invoice one month ahead of time, they sent it to the wrong address because the bank has changed their PO box . The insurance company showed documentation that the PO box and fax number change notification was mailed out in XX/XX/XXXX, more than three months after the original invoice was sent out. Moreover, the bank mailed payment late, it was post marked on a date that would identify it as being late, and was the correct amount ( price had increased from year prior ). \\n\\nEssentially, the bank held onto my escrow payment last minute, paid the bill late, and I had a gap in coverage. Then - they tried to coerce me into paying XXXX dollars for three days of insurance coverage, which is 67 times more than what it actually costs, due to their obvious mishandling of my escrow money.

              " [\"i am the cosigner on my son 's private XXXX student loans that began in XX/XX/XXXX when he was attending XXXX school. There are four student loans that were initially serviced by XXXX  itself. Then XXXX contracted with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ) and they became the services of the loans. This went on for a few years as I recall when we were notified earlier this year in about XX/XX/XXXX of this year that the loans had been sold to Navient and we would receive further information as the process was underway.\\n\\nAt the time that the loans had been sold to Navient, our payment date had always been the XX/XX/XXXX.Since possible dates for payment ranged from the XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, I believed that logically our date would be XX/XX/XXXX since our payment date had been XX/XX/XXXX. When we received a notice from XXXX that Navient may be changing our payment date to XX/XX/XXXX, we were informed that we could set our own date on the XXXX website.. Believing that up to the change in servicing we could change the payment date on .XXXX   website I tried and was locked out. I called XXXX about it and was told that they could no longer do that as the Navient process had already begun- however our loan had not yet been batched and sent to Naveint at that time. I called Navient and Navient 's rep said they couldn't help regarding my request for XX/XX/XXXX as a payment date as they didn't have the files yet.\\n\\nSo I waited and called again in early XX/XX/XXXX before XX/XX/XXXX when I learned that the first payment would be due on XX/XX/XXXX. I was confused about the due dates so close together. and was told by a Naveint rep that he would input the request for the date to be changed to XX/XX/XXXX and I should not worry about paying on XX/XX/XXXX but that I should make the payment in XX/XX/XXXX by XX/XX/XXXX. He said that the request should be granted and I would receive a letter from Navient. In XX/XX/XXXX I began receiving phone calls with no message from a Tennessee number beginning at XXXX XXXX. I finally returned the call and learned that it was Navient wondering where the XX/XX/XXXX payment was? I asked what happened to my request for change of the date of payment and the rep said initially that it had been processed, and would probably not take effect until XX/XX/XXXX. She then left and came back and said that the change had been requested out of their cycle and couldn't be processed and then I was told by the same supervisor that she would input the request today and expedite and that it really hadn't been in the system at all as there was no file to attach the request to when I had called in XX/XX/XXXX. She stated that now it wouldn't be possible to change the date until XX/XX/XXXX.\\n\\nI called again on XX/XX/XXXX after receiving another call at XXXX XXXX from an unknown caller from Tennessee with no message left ( now I knew that it was Navient ) thinking that it was about the change in payment date only to learn hat nothing had changed and they were still wondering where the XX/XX/XXXX payment was and that even if my request for a change in payment date was expedited that it would not be effective until XX/XX/XXXX ....\\n\\nThat a company would take over ownership and servicing of a huge amount of student loans without preparing the proper lT program or training their personnel so that the files could be transferred seamlessly - to take on that kind of financial responsibility in such a cavalier manner - is reckless and negligent and surely a breach of contract to say the least.. XXXX and Navient gave incomplete and inaccurate information to the borrowers. The borrowers are third party beneficiaries of the contract between XXXX  and Navient for the sale/servicing of the loans. While Navient has stated that they are honoring the agreement that we had for reduced interest rates based on our income situation, when that period is over what then? Navient says they have no such program.\\n\\nThe long term effects of change in ownership of these loans was never explained to us.No copy of the agreement between XXXX and Navient has been made available to the borrowers so that they can be aware of what Naveint has agreed to do regarding these loans. It is all hearsay. It is needs to be published for all the borrowers and co signers to see so that they can demand their rights under the new contract.\\n\\nBecause late payments are reported to the credit reporting agencies and affect our credit scores, this payment date issue is a big deal. Yet Navient has taken setting these dates like a XXXX shoot. Luck of the draw? Why XX/XX/XXXX?. Why not set it on XX/XX/XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX? Wasn't that the more logical date from the beginning?\"],\n",

              " ['On or around XX/XX/2019, I deposited $ 5000+ into a BMO Harris account that had a {$500.00} incentive offer associated with it. At the time I was in the branch office in XXXX XXXX in XXXX, FL, there was a concern I had that the incentive offer was based on the wording that the money be deposited the same day as the account was opened. I brought this to the attention of XXXX, the branch manager there, and she assured me that if there was any problem because of that, she would take care of it. I just spoke with her today ( XX/XX/2019 ), more than 6 months after I opened the account, and she is wrongly telling me that I was supposed to do a wire transfer the next day. I told her that is not what her and I agreed on which was a bank to bank transfer. If what she was saying was true ( which is it not ), then she should have contacted me 2 business days later if she did not see the money and told me I was disqualified. However, I am 100 % certain that she knew and agreed to the bank to bank transfer, which can sometimes take 6 to 8 business days, which can amount to as much as 12 calendar days in some cases. \\n\\nIt appears to me they are trying to look for false excuses to not pay me, even though I was assured I should be fine. I asked at least once for XXXX to give me written confirmation of her word but she never sent it to me, making me think she was trying to \" XXXX me over \\'\\' all along. She claims she is trying to escalate it up the chain of command, but the agreement was that SHE would take care of any problems, not the higher ups. She appears to be looking for ways not to pay me the {$500.00} but the agreement was made and I met all of the requirements ( with the exception of the same day deposit but that requirement was verbally waived by XXXX ). \\n\\nI am requesting that if they say they told me I had to pay via wire transfer only, that they show written proof of that. If they can not, then they can not prove that is what they told me. My very clear recollection is that I told them I would be doing a bank to bank transfer and have to wait to go through the security procedures for doing that and they agreed. I gave them the example \" Do you expect people to just walk in this bank with {$5000.00} cash in their pocket? That seems unreasonable \\'\\'. They agreed to that statement and told me a bank to bank transfer is fine and reasonable. \\n\\nThey are telling me on the phone that because it took 11 days to deposit the money that it was \" too long \\'\\' but they never told me any time limit to do the bank to bank transfer. They mentioned 10 days which is very suspicious because it is 1 day less than what I may have taken. Since I am at the mercy of the bank funding the bank to bank transfer ( and somewhat at the mercy of the receiving bank too ), I should not be penalized for taking 11 days to transfer the money. I remember I had a few challenges to get that transfer to work so it was not simple like just pushing a button. \\n\\nBMO Harris should be reprimanded for doing this to me. If they \" knew \\'\\' I would not qualify, they should have let me know early so I could have taken my money out and invested in elsewhere. However since I feel I met ALL the requirements, I am holding them to the {$500.00} and if they do not pay, I am prepared to contact the local news and report them to warn other people NOT to bank at BMO Harris and possibly even sue them in small claims court. I had a similar problem with another bank ( XXXX XXXX ) but  I \" fought \\'\\' them and they paid. I am prepared to \" fight \\'\\' again with this bank that is XXXX me around bigtime. \\n\\nThank you.'],\n",

Everything was ready except that there was no proof that my taxes had been paid by Flagstar Bank, who held my mortgage. I looked at my account online and could not find the payment, which was due XXXX, then delinquent after XXXX. I called Flagstar Bank. \" XXXX  \\'\\', in the escrow dept, explained that the taxes were not paid because they had sent a payoff to XXXX XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX and on the 2nd page of their docs explained that Flagstar put a stop on my escrow during the period that the payoff covered. An updated payoff was ordered on XXXX as well, so Flagstar continued to freeze my escrow account. I called XXXX XXXX  and was informed that Flagstar was obligated to pay my taxes so we agreed to do a conference call the next day.\\n\\nXX/XX/2020( Friday ) : Conferenced with \" XXXX \\'\\', a supervisor in escrow at Flagstar. She again explained the \" escrow disbursement stop \\'\\' policy. We explained that no one told the borrower, me, that this occured and that the taxes had not been paid and were now delinquent. We requested that the taxes be paid that same day, including the penalties. XXXX  informed us that it had to go to another dept and would take until at least the XX/XX/XXXXor XX/XX/XXXX( Monday, Tuesday, respectively ) and that I would receive an email.\\n\\nXX/XX/2020 ( Monday ) : I did not receive an email. I spoke to \" XXXX  \\'\\' in customer service 1st, who told me that there was no resolution, and transferred me to XXXX, in the escrow dept. XXXX  said that the money was dispersed, it was being sent by XXXX  XXXX  today, and a tracking number would be available tomorrow. I asked for an email confirming that in writing. XX/XX/2020 ( Tuesday ) : I only received an email that the issue had been resolved. No specifics on even what the issue was, no tracking number, no information. I called again and was told it was dispersed yesterday, but no specific information, which I needed for my refi. I was transferred to \" XXXX  \\'\\' in the tax dept, who said the tax dispersement would take 3-5 days, which is not what I was told earlier. She was rude and impatient, promptly transferring me to a team leader. I waited over an hour on hold for a team leader to become available. \" XXXX  \\'\\', the team leader, explained that taxes are paid by a 3rd party and that people who do the work do not take the phone calls. She would ask \" XXXX  \\'\\' to put my case at the top of his list. There was no tracking number available to her anywhere, which was something that had changed. This phone call took 2 solid hours.XX/XX/2020 ( Monday ) : The amount paid for taxes was higher than the amount due. Amount due if on time ( 1XXXX-XXXX ) = {$3600.00}. Amount due if delinquent ( after XXXX ) = {$3900.00}. Flagstar took the entire amount from my escrow account, although it was Flagstar who did not pay my taxes on time, although they had ample time to pay within the allotted window. I wanted Flagstar to pay the delinquency penalty so I called Flagstar again, speaking first to \" XXXX  \\'\\'. After I explained the concerns she transferred me to the payoff dept, although I told her it was an escrow issue. In payoff I explained everything again to XXXX, who told me I needed to talk to an escrow agent. Instead I agreed to talk to a supervisor, \" XXXX  \\'\\'. After hearing the concerns he reiterated Flagstar \\'s policy of freezing the escrow accounts during refi \\'s. I asked him why they would do that, what was the goal, to not pay a customer \\'s bills that they were obligated to pay. Furthermore, not to even tell the customer. He said it was so they would not have to change their payout paperwork, \" so escrows don\\'t change \\'\\'. I requested the Flagstar refund me the amount of the delinquency, {$360.00}. He declined, reiterating that it is their policy to freeze the escrow account.\\n\\nOn every phone call ( 2-3 employees for each call ) I told each Flagstar employee that I had no idea that my taxes were not paid. They had ample time to pay my taxes, despite the refi process. They were obligated to pay my bills, they had my money for that purpose. I should have been informed ( I was told they do not have enough staff to call every customer who is doing a refi. ) I believe that when there are bills due the customer MUST be called. It is my name, my credit, that is being impacted. What if had been my homeowner \\'s insurance and there was a fire, earthquake etc? I might have lost everything.\\n\\nOn at least 2 calls I was told that they were documenting my complaints against their policy. No one has contacted me to discuss my concerns. It is not in the customer \\'s best interest for Flagstar to decide not to pay escrow bills that they are obligated to pay. I spent almost 10 hours on the phone trying to get my taxes paid. My last call was for reimbursement of the money that they took out of my escrow to pay delinquency penalties because they did not pay my taxes. They did not inform me that they were using my money to pay for their deliberate decision to let my taxes become delinquent. My name and good credit may have been compromised. Flagstar refused.\\n\\nThat is all that I am asking for myself, the {$360.00} that they took from my account. For other Flagstar customers and other companies that may have this self-serving, ludicrous policy, I would ask that stopping/freezing escrow accounts not be a legal process. No one should have to go through all of this stress to have their taxes paid on time. There is no reason for this policy other than saving them time and effort.

According to the terms of the card, I am supposed to get 3 % cash back on a category of my choice ( which has been \" Online Shopping \\'\\' since I first received the card ) for up to {$2500.00} in purchases each quarter. Around the time I got the card, I contacted Bank of America through their XXXX page to ask if the quarters were based on 3-month calendar quarters, or if they were based on statement dates or calculated some other way. I also asked if a transaction was grouped into a given quarter based on the transaction date or the posting date. On XX/XX/2020, I received a message from ^XXXX  ( from BoA ) through XXXX . They said ( in part ), \" The 1st quarter begins XX/XX/XXXX and ends XX/XX/XXXX. Since we honor the transaction date, a purchase made on XX/XX/2020 that posts on XX/XX/2020 will be applied to the first quarter. \\'\\' I proceeded to use my card based on that information. I received accurate cash back until my XXXX statement when I received an amount I could not figure out. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called BoA by phone and tried to figure out what was going on. I first spoke to XXXX, who explained that I had exceeded my {$2500.00}, and thus, was only getting 1 % cash back for a portion of my purchases on that statement. I told him that I had only spent {$2400.00} so far in the second quarter and that everything on my XXXX statement ( with the exception of the foreign transaction fee, which I understand does not generate any cash back ) was an online purchase and should have been eligible for 3 %. XXXX continued to state that I exceeded my {$2500.00}, but did not offer any proof or explanation of that claim. I asked for a supervisor, and was transferred to a woman who seemed very professional ( unfortunately, I do not remember her name ). After putting me on hold, she agreed that something was strange, and that my cash back did not seem to have been computed correctly. She said that she could not alter the cash back amount, but that she could offer me a statement credit in the amount of {$5.00}. She was clear with me that the {$5.00} was more than the amount I was entitled to ( after being added to the cash back I actually did receive ), but she explained that she was figuring out the difference between the cash back I had received that quarter and the total cash back I should have received for spending the full {$2500.00} ( as stipulated above, I had not quite spent the whole {$2500.00}, so, as she and I were both aware, she was giving me a little more than I was actually entitled to ). I asked her when I could expect the credit to post, and she said by Monday or Tuesday ( XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX ). I thanked her, and hung up very satisfied. However, by Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I did not yet have the credit. I called BoA again and spoke with XXXX. After looking into what was going on, he said that he could see that I had called on XX/XX/XXXX, but that there was no notation of any credit having been given. He also said that there were no \" notes \\'\\' made by the people I spoke to, which he seemed to think was unusual. He reviewed the case some more and said that he felt I had gone over my {$2500.00} cap due to 3 transactions made at the end of XXXX that posted on XX/XX/XXXX. I explained what I was told on XXXX about the cash back quarter being based on the transaction date not the posting date. He said that was not true, to which I said that I was making purchase decisions ( including doing more business with BoA ) as a result of that misinformation. I also asked why I was promised a {$5.00} credit and didn\\'t receive it. He said he would have someone call me back within 1 business day. That would have been by XX/XX/XXXX.

First of all, it is all a lie that Oportun is telling it to my references friends, that I have late payments and that they have not been able to contact me, especially I do not have any problem with making payments to them and my checking account shows that they collected the money and that's fine, now XXXX XXXX XXXX told me that it was a confusion and that they will try to fix the problem, all this happened, today XX/XX/XXXX, in an hour later I received a called from XXXX XXXX, my friend, that Oportun called him because they are trying to contact me and that they have not had any success in reached me, so I called Oportun again and let my friend listen the conversation, and he found out how bad Oportun is doing with me, again the guy from Oportun said everything was fine. Those calls that Oportun is doing to my friends is putting me in a bad situation with them and this harassment is giving me so many headaches. I would like to be able to bring a legal action against them, but I do not know what my rights are that I have. So Im demanding that Oportun, pay me for the loss or waste of my time, the damages and prejudices that Oportun had having brought against me. Please, help me with this matters, thanks\"],\n",

I have previously sent you a request to validate my debt under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and all I received was an itemized list of the alleged charges you claim I owe you. This does not meet the Federal Trade Commissions guidelines of what constitutes proper debt validation In addition, in the case of Spears Vs. Brennan ( IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF INDIANA, No. 49A02-0003-CV-169 ), the court ruled that : 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ( emphasis added ). On November 12, 1996, nineteen days after the date of Brennans debt collection letter, Spears counsel Shepard sent Brennan a letter declaring that Spears disputes your debt collection-related allegations, denies the same, and demands strict proof and verification thereof. Record at 21. As such, Brennan should have ceased his debt collection efforts immediately upon receiving that letter. Instead, Brennan proceeded to obtain a default judgment against Spears on the debt collection claim before he had mailed Spears the necessary verification and, thus, violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ).\\n\\nBrennan maintains, however, that there was no violation of the FDCPA because he sent adequate verification of the debt [ to Spears ] in the October 30, 1996 notice of claim. Brief of Appellee at 13. Specifically, Brennan claims that a copy of the consumer credit contract between Spears and American General attached to the notice of claim provided sufficient verification of the debt within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). We can not agree.\\n\\nThe contract in no way provides sufficient verification of the debt. A review of the document reveals that it identifies only the terms of Spears loan, including a 17.99 % annual interest rate and the original loan amount of {$2500.00}. The loan agreement contains no accounting of any payments made by Spears, the dates on which those payments were made, the interest which had accrued, or any late fees which had been assessed once Spears stopped making the required payments. Indeed, the existing unpaid contract balance at the time Brennan sent the debt collection notice was at least {$350.00} more than the original loan amount. Therefore, Brennan violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) when he failed to cease collection of the debt by obtaining a default judgment against Spears after Spears had notified Brennan in writing that he was disputing the debt but before Brennan had mailed verification of the debt to Spears. We reverse the trial courts entry of summary judgment in favor of Brennan on this issue. \\n\\nI notice that you are still reporting this collection on my credit report, which is considered to be a collection activity. You are now in violation of the FCPDA, and are now subject to fines of {$1000.00}, plus actual damages and attorneys fees, which I may collect from you by filing a claim in small claims court. These collections on my credit report are causing me severe problems in trying to purchase a home and the damage could lead into the $ 1000s. \\n\\nYou should also be aware that reporting such invalidated information to major credit bureaus might constitute defamation of character, as the negative marks on my credit report harm my credit and prevent me from enjoying all the benefits of good credit. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) does not allow the inaccurate reporting of information on my credit report and under this act. Therefore, if you do not immediately remove this account from my credit report, you are subject to another {$1000.00} fine, plus punitive damages. I'm sure your legal staff will agree that non-compliance with this request could put your company in serious legal trouble with the FTC and other state or federal agencies. \\n\\nI intend to follow through with the suit if I do not hear back from you.\"],\n",
